Currently Supported Entity Types and Relationships: 

  - Process: Windows processes and applications 

  - Host: Network hosts/machines (agents) 

  - User: User accounts 

  - File: Files and executables (dlls)

Note: Bidirectional relationships are supported 
  1. Outbound Relationships: What the source entity does TO other entities 

  2. Inbound Relationships: What other entities do TO the source entity 

  3. Directional Label System: Uses reverse relationship suffixes
