# THF (Threat Hunting Framework)

An AI-powered natural language interface for Wazuh SIEM using LangChain and Anthropic Claude.

---

# 📖 User Guide

## Overview

THF (Threat Hunting Framework) is a sophisticated AI-powered security analysis platform that provides a conversational interface to Wazuh SIEM data. The system leverages Claude AI (Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4) through LangChain to enable security analysts to investigate security incidents, analyze alerts, and understand their security posture using natural language queries.

The framework converts user queries into structured function calls, executes them against the Wazuh OpenSearch backend and Wazuh API, and returns actionable security insights with full context preservation across multi-turn conversations.

| **Entity to Entity** | Map direct relationships between specified entities by finding shared events, or direct interactions in the security data. Identifies which entities interact with each other and assesses the strength of relationship, type and risk scoring based on alert severity for security investigation and lateral movement detection. |
| **Behavioral Correlation** | Identify correlated behavioral patterns or activities across multiple entities that occur in similar timeframes, suggesting coordinated actions, attack chains, or systematic behaviors. |

**Example Queries:**

**Entity to Entity:**
- "Show me which hosts user SYSTEM accessed today."
- "Which users have accessed host with IP 192.168.201.33 in the past 24 hours?"
- "Show me all files that were loaded by the svchost.exe process over the past 6 hours"
- "What files were deleted by process TiWorker.exe on May 15 2025?"

| **Attack Progression** | Tracks how an attack evolved and progressed over time, identifying attack chains. Focuses on critical events and shows how attackers moved from initial compromise to later stages. |
| **Temporal Correlation** | Finds events that occurred close together in time (within a specified time window), helping identify related activities that might be part of the same attack or incident. |

**Example Queries:**

**Show Sequence:**
- "Show me the event sequence for host server-01 from 2pm to 4pm."
- "Display the sequence of events yesterday between 06:00:00 and 12:00:00"
- "Show a sequential timeline of all critical alerts over the past 12 hours"

## Using THF for Threat Hunting

### Getting Started

1. **Ask Initial Questions**: Start with broad queries to understand your security posture
   - "Show me critical alerts from today"
   - "Which agents are disconnected?"
   - "What are the top 10 hosts with most alerts?"

2. **Follow-Up Questions**: THF remembers context from previous queries
   - After seeing alerts: "Give me more details on those critical alerts"
   - After seeing a host: "What about authentication failures on that host?"
   - After investigating: "Show me the timeline for those events"

3. **Investigate Entities**: Deep-dive into specific hosts, users, processes, or files
   - "What alerts are there for host win10-01?"
   - "Show me all activity for user administrator in the last 24 hours"
   - "What files did powershell.exe create today?"

4. **Detect Threats**: Look for MITRE ATT&CK techniques and suspicious patterns
   - "Find T1055 process injection techniques detected recently"
   - "Show me unusual login patterns from yesterday"
   - "Are there any credential dumping attempts?"

5. **Map Relationships**: Understand connections between entities
   - "Which users accessed host win10-01 today?"
   - "What processes did cmd.exe create?"
   - "Show me files accessed by suspicious processes"

### Session Management

- Each conversation maintains context across multiple queries
- Use the "Reset Session" button in the sidebar to start a new investigation
- View session information to see conversation history

```bash
# Reset session memory
POST /reset?session_id=your-session-id

### Key Architectural Features

#### Session-Based Memory Management
- **Isolated Contexts**: Each user session maintains separate conversation memory
- **Prevents Memory Bleed**: Concurrent users don't interfere with each other
- **Context-Aware Follow-ups**: System remembers entities, filters, and time ranges from previous queries
- **Token Optimization**: ConversationSummaryBufferMemory with 1500 token limit

#### Intelligent Context Preservation
The `ConversationContextProcessor` (agent/context_processor.py:1) analyzes conversations to:
- Detect contextual references ("these alerts", "that host")
- Extract entities from previous responses
- Preserve temporal context across queries
- Enrich follow-up queries with relevant filters

#### Smart Routing & Field Detection
- **Automatic Field Mapping**: Detects whether to use agent.id or agent.name
- **Process Intelligence**: Searches across originalFileName, image, commandLine
- **Multi-field Search**: Comprehensive coverage for hosts, processes, files
- **Natural Language Time Parsing**: Supports "3 days ago", "yesterday 6am-11am"

#### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
The agent (`agent/wazuh_agent.py:214`) handles API overload gracefully:
- Detects 529 (overload) errors automatically
- Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s intervals
- User-friendly error messages
- Maintains conversation state during retries

#### Type Safety & Validation
- **Pydantic Schemas**: All function parameters are validated
- **Enum-Based Selection**: Action and entity types use enums
- **Automatic Serialization**: JSON conversion handled automatically
- **Request Validation**: FastAPI validates all API requests

### Adding New Functions

1. Create a new module in the appropriate `functions/` subdirectory
2. Implement the `execute()` function with proper parameters
3. Add Pydantic schema for parameter validation
4. Add the function to the corresponding LangChain tool in `tools/`
5. Update documentation and add tests

## Monitoring

### Observability

- **LangSmith**: Trace agent interactions and function calls
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with context
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing support
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection (optional)
